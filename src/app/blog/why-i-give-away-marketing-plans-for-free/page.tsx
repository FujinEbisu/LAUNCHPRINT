        <p className="mb-4 text-[var(--primary)]">Let’s get real. A month ago, I launched <Link href="https://launch-print.com" className="text-[var(--accent2)] underline">launch-print.com</Link>, a site built for absolute beginner marketers, people who don’t know what to do first and get crushed by the noise online.</p>
        <p className="mb-4 text-[var(--primary)]">Here’s the weird part: Since day one, I’ve been giving away full marketing strategies for free. I’ve helped 50, maybe 60 people, not charging a cent, using the tool I built for myself.</p>
        <p className="mb-4 text-[var(--primary)]">Anyone “serious” about business is going to say: “You’re a fool. You could be charging! Why are you working for free? You’re just letting people walk all over you.”</p>
        <p className="mb-4 text-[var(--primary)]">And you know what? They’re dead wrong.</p>
        <p className="mb-4 text-[var(--primary)]">When I started, the fear in my gut screamed: “You’re wasting your time. They’ll take, never pay, and you’ll burn out.” But here’s the truth, wouldn’t have this traction, this feedback, or this level of trust from actual beginners, if I’d started by charging.</p>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-[var(--primary)] mt-8 mb-4">Why I Help for Free (And Why It’s Not Charity)</h2>
        <p className="mb-4 text-[var(--primary)]">Because it’s the only way a real beginner ever gets over the hill of “Can I even do this?” Paid courses, info dumps, five-step “growth hacks”, they promise the world and deliver fluff.</p>
        <p className="mb-4 text-[var(--primary)]">I saw it in every DM, email, and Reddit comment: People need real, practical help before they’ll trust you with their wallet. They want to feel a win, not just read “value-packed” posts.</p>
        <p className="mb-4 text-[var(--primary)]">Giving away value before you ask for anything? It’s not soft. It’s the only way to build fidelity (yeah, real trust, not “loyalty points”) with people who are overwhelmed, broke, and totally new.</p>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-[var(--primary)] mt-8 mb-4">Most Funnel Gurus Won’t Tell You This</h2>
        <p className="mb-4 text-[var(--primary)]">My tool helps beginners because I’ve walked through the same mud. I’m showing, not just telling, exactly what works. Helping for free is my “main hunting technique,” not a random act of kindness.</p>
        <p className="mb-4 text-[var(--primary)]">Why? Because my REAL customer, the one who sticks, subscribes, and tells five friends, is the person who saw me help, no strings attached, and got their first real customer using my system.</p>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-[var(--primary)] mt-8 mb-4">The Hard Truth: Beginners Don’t Buy Without Proof</h2>
        <p className="mb-4 text-[var(--primary)]">If that means it takes ten free plans to land one paid user, so be it. I’d rather win by reputation than ride the hype wave, churning and burning through cold leads.</p>
        <p className="mb-4 text-[var(--primary)]">This approach is slower, but it’s real. And real always beats “growth hacks” in the long game.</p>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-[var(--primary)] mt-8 mb-4">Why Am I Telling You This?</h2>
        <p className="mb-4 text-[var(--primary)]">Because you’re probably being bombarded by people pitching quick fixes now. But if you’re a true beginner, you don’t need a guru. You need someone who’ll answer your dumbest question, hand you a real checklist, and show you a win, before the word “credit card” ever comes up.</p>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-[var(--primary)] mt-8 mb-4">What Next?</h2>
        <p className="mb-4 text-[var(--primary)]">If you’re stuck on your first marketing step, DM me.</p>
        <p className="mb-4 text-[var(--primary)]">No script, no pitch, no payment form. Just tell me what you’re trying to do with your business, and I’ll help you map the first week.</p>
        <p className="mb-4 text-[var(--primary)]">THEN, when you see it’s working, you’re free to use <Link href="https://launch-print.com" className="text-[var(--accent2)] underline">launch-print.com</Link> for as long or as little as you want.</p>
        <p className="mb-4 text-[var(--primary)]">PS: Go ahead and call me a fool. I’ll be too busy helping the NEXT “nobody” get their first client to care.</p>
        <p className="mb-4 text-[var(--primary)]">PPS: If you want a shortcut, my site gives you a free 7-day checklist, no sign-up, no catch. I built it for you.</p>
